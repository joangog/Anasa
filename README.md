heatmap-web-project
===================

### Anasa

A prototype for a web app that could be used for promoting green and healthy city transportations.

Short Description
-----------------

### User

This app allows users to upload part or all of their Google Maps Location data and get a score based on their CO2 emissions. The user can also see their location data on a heatmap, along with their position among the city's highest scores (only first names shown for users' privacy)

### Admin

The admin functionality allows for an additional use case. Apart from managing data from the database, the admin has access to an aggregate heatmap that gathers all location data uploaded from the users. This is strictly aggregate (the admin has no access to an individual's location data) and allows the admin (e.g. municipality, other civil services) to study the most popular destinations for the city.

Development
